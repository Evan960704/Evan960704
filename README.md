# It's Evan! 👋


✈️After undergraduate university I was working as a flight attendant during 2018-2020 at a Chinese airline company named China Southern, yes don't be confused just as what you are thinking of, it's true. Try to talk with me about your native country, maybe I've been there for times!

🏫 I’m currently learning Anthropology in Humannities of Faculty at Hokkaido University, which is located in a super northern island of Japan and full of snow all over the year, ok it's joking ;) but it's quite cold anyway.

🏋️And for my research, I'm now focusing on [CrossFit](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%83%88) in Japan, a type also the name of a gym originated in the United States, and trying to find the interaction among this and body anthropology, also Affect theories which is quite popular the recent several years. So if you're a dynamic menmber of CrossFit, let's chat more about that!

About the future? Not determined yet, but hopefully I could be an awesome communicator with all my language skills although they're still not mature enough but... who knows the next right? 😉
